# Project Requirement

The database that you develop will be for tracking animals that are taken to the SPCA/Humane Society, rescued by animal rescuers and housed at independently owned shelters and (hopefully) eventually adopted by a family. You will track the location(s) of the animals, the people involved, and the adoptions of the animals. Of course, this application lends itself nicely to finding cute pictures of cats, dogs, bunnies and cute rodents, but along the way, you will hopefully learn some database skills.



Animal Rescue Application

The course project is intended to give students an opportunity to participate in all phases of the development of a database application. The development of the application will require you to use ER modeling techniques, relational modeling techniques, SQL, and to access your database via a web application. Projects are to be done in groups of no more than 3 individuals. The groups will remain the same for the entire course. Students may choose to work alone or in smaller groups, but no compensation will be made for this when marking. All assignments will be marked equally, regardless of the number of people in the group.
The entire project requirements are stated here. For the first deliverable, you only need to hand in your Entity- Relationship diagram, a list of assumptions made, and the Relational Schema (the DDL file used to build your application -- which should include insert statements showing the data that you have loaded into your database).
Project Requirements
Data Requirements
Animals end up at a local branch of the SPCA either by animal control workers who find animals wandering free without an owner or they may be dropped off by owners who can no longer care for them. The hope is that someone will adopt the animal from the SPCA, however, this doesn't always happen. In this case, animals are often rescued by animal rescuers (such as No Paw Left Behind) -- usually volunteer organizations that are notified when an animal has been at the SPCA for too long and is in danger of being euthanized. The rescuers arrange for a shelter to take the animal temporarily until a home can be found for the animal (such as Save Me Dog Rescue). The difference between the rescuers and the shelter -- the rescuers transport the animal from the SPCA and locate a shelter who will board the animal until it is adopted. There are many people involved in this operation -- people that work for the branches of the SPCA, volunteers that run the rescue operations, volunteers that help the rescuers (by transporting animals from one location to another -- we'll call these "drivers") and shelter owners/workers as well as the people who adopt the animals.
